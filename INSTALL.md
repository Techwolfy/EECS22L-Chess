Installing Knight++
===================

Knight++ has few requirements, so installation is simple.

To install:
-----------

* Download and extract the `Chess_V1.0.tar.gz` archive.
* Copy the `chess` binary from the resulting `bin` directory to a new location, if desired.
* Ensure that the `chess` binary is executable (`chmod +x chess`) and has write access to its local directory.
* To begin a game, simply `cd` to the directory containing `chess` and run `./chess`.
